## Inventory & Purchasing



### Part Order Requests

This tool is intended to make it easier to let us know if a part is needed, and what it's for. You can find everything to do with purchase requests under the Inventory Menu at the top of the Malley Internal Home Page. If you don't have access to that, ask Myles or Kayla for help. 



#### Creating a New Request

Head over to https://index.malleyindustries.com/syspro/purchasing/newRequest

You will be presented with a Request Form. Please fill in as much information as you possibly can, especially if you are requesting a non-stock or new part.

If you know the part number, you can start typing it into the Part Number field. As you type, a list of possible  matches will appear. Clicking on a match will fill out most of the form for you.

## Labour Tracking



### For Staff



#### Overview

This is a simple tool for keeping track of the labour done on the jobs we do. All this tool tracks is who works on what and for how long.



#### Logging In

An account will be created for you, including a password. You can change your password to something memorable whenever you want. 

The computers on the shop floor will show the login screen automatically. If you do not see it, follow the links for Labour, or go to https://index.malleyindustries.com/labour

The first thing you will see is this:

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 12-40-32.png)

Choose the first letter of your last name.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 12-42-07.png)

Choose your name from the list by clicking on it. At any time, if you need to go back, you can click the button in the top right.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 12-43-15.png)

Enter your password. If this is your first time, you will have been given a temporary one. If you have forgotten your password or are having trouble signing in, let your supervisor know to have it reset. 



#### Logging Out

At any time, you can log out by clicking on the **Log Out** button at the top right corner of the screen.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 12-47-21.png)

As a courtesy to other staff, you should always **Log Out** after you are finished clocking in or out.



#### Clocking In

To clock in to a job, select it from the **Choose A Job** list you see when you first clock in. The different tabs are the prefixes that are used to categorize jobs. The **RECENT** tab shows the last 10 or so jobs that you have clocked in on if they are still open.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/.png)

The **SEARCH** tab can be used to find jobs if you don't want to filter through a long list. Start typing in the job number and the best matches will be shown.  

When you have found the job you want, click on the large yellow **Start on JOB####** button next to the job number and description. 

If you are done, make sure you **Log Out**.



#### Clocking Out

If you are finished working or are done on a job and ready to work on another one, log in as before. You will see a green box that looks like this:

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-45-46.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Click the **Clock out of ######** button at the top right of the screen. You will then be able to **Log Out** or **Clock In** to a different job.



### For Supervisors / Management

#### Reviewing Staff Tme

To look up labour for a person, department or particular day, click on the **Labour** menu at the top of your screen, and then click on the **See and Make Changes To Labour** link.

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-50-08.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />

From here, you will be presented with a box with different options.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-52-43.png)

The reports filter based on the inputs given. All Staff returns work on a single date. By Department filters by department for a single date. By Person and Dates takes an individual and returns their labour between a start and end date. 

When you have, for example, selected a date to look up and hit **Go**, the screen will update with all matching results. The results are presented in the form of a person's daily Time Card.

Somone who has booked labour on a day will look something like this:

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-56-27.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />

A day with no labour on it looks like this:

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-56-48.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-56-48" style="zoom: 50%;" />



#### Add New Time

If a person has forgotten to clock on to a job, you can add time to their time card. Find the correct person and date using one of the options provided:

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-52-43.png" style="zoom:33%;" />

In the top-right corner of the time card in question, click the green **Add** button. A new green form will appear to the right hand side of the time card you are editing.  **The time card you are working with will also change colour to be easier to see**.

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 14-04-34.png" style="zoom: 33%;" />

Fill in the green **Add Labour to [NAME] on [DATE]** form fields. They are all required. 

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 14-06-10.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

The box at the bottom of the form will let you choose the job they are working on. The **RECENT** tab shows the last few jobs that person has been clocked in to that are still open in Syspro. the **SEARCH** tab allows you to find the right one you are looking for.

When you are done, click on the **Add Labour** button. If there are no errors to be fixed, the time is added and the person's time card is updated.

If there are errors, you will be prompted to fix them before you can add the time. 

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-10-00.png" style="zoom:33%;" />

You can cancel this at any time before saving changes. If you leave the page or go to make changes on another record before saving this new labour though, it will be lost.



#### Edit an Existing Record

NOTE 1: You can only make changes to labour records if they haven't been posted to Syspro already. 

NOTE 2: You can make changes to a labour record when they are clocked out. If they are not clocked out yet, this must be done first. See **Clock Someone Out**.

Click on a record on a time card. A dark blue window will appear on the right side of your screen. You can change any details about the record you wish, including the job.

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-07-53.png" style="zoom:50%;" />



When you have finished, click the blue Save Changes to Labour button. You can cancel this at any time as well.



#### Delete Time

Note: Once a labour record is deleted, it can't be brought back. 

You can delete a record entirely if it was added in error.  Follow the steps to edit the record but instead of making changes, click the red Delete Labour button at the bottom of the blue box. 

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-08-15.png" style="zoom:50%;" />



#### Clock Someone Out

If someone is currently clocked in, their time card will look something like this:

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-08-57.png" style="zoom: 67%;" />

If you click on the **ongoing** record, a light blue box on the right will appear that will allow you to manually clock that person off the job they are working on.

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-09-18.png" style="zoom:50%;" />





### Managing Production Staff Accounts

This section explains the steps to manage staff accounts. Everything herein can be reached from the **Admin** menu at the top of the page. If you don't see the **Admin** menu but you should, let Myles or Kayla know to update your account.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-34-33.png)



#### See All Staff Accounts

From the **Admin Menu** click on **See All**. You will be presented with a list of all existing staff accounts. 

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-34-53.png)

The name, department, account status and other options are listed for each person. Employee accounts are never deleted, even if they no longer work with us to maintain records. However, their account status shows whether or not they can log in or not. An account listed as **LOCKED** does not appear in the login menu.



#### Add New Production Staff

To add a new staff account, click on the **Add Staff** button from the list of **All Staff**, or click on the **Add New Production Staff** link in the **Admin Menu**.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-35-02.png)

You will be presented with a simple form that requires very little information.

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-37-44.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

All fields are required.

The **Password** field will be pre-filled with a introductory password in the format of **Welcome[random number]**. This pre-filled password will be different every time, so please make note of it. You can also substitute that for a different one if you prefer. 

As soon as you click **Create Account** the person will be able to sign in using the password you provided. 



#### Lock Out Production Staff

When someone is no longer with the company, their account needs to be locked to prevent them from signing in. To do so, find the person in the **All Staff** list and click on the **Edit** button.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-35-29.png)

At the bottom of the page, you'll see a red **LOCK ACCOUNT** button. Clicking it will disable their ability to log in.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-36-51.png)

If a mistake was made, or that employee rejoins the company, their account can be re-enabled by following the same process as locking their account. However this time, the form will look like this:

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-37-03.png)



#### Reset Someone's Password

If someone has forgotten their password, find them in the **All Staff** list and click the **Reset Password** link next to their name. 

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-35-29.png)

You will be presented with a form that looks like this:

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-22 10-36-20.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />

NOTE 1: The passord you use is **case sensitive** and has to be at least six characters long. For exmaple, **pass11** and **Pass11** are not the same thing. There are no other rules or requirements. The user's password can be any combination of letters, numbers and symbols. In this situaiton, they do not need to be strong - just memorable. 

NOTE 2: There is no way to recover a forgotten password. The only way to regain access is to reset it to something new.
