### Part Order Requests

This tool is intended to make it easier to let us know if a part is needed, and what it's for. You can find everything to do with purchase requests under the Inventory Menu at the top of the Malley Internal Home Page. If you don't have access to that, ask Myles or Kayla for help. 



#### Creating a New Request

Head over to https://index.malleyindustries.com/syspro/purchasing/newRequest

You will be presented with a Request Form. Please fill in as much information as you possibly can, especially if you are requesting a non-stock or new part.

If you know the part number, you can start typing it into the Part Number field. As you type, a list of possible  matches will appear. Clicking on a match will fill out most of the form for you.

## Labour Tracking

### For Staff

#### Overview

This is a simple tool for keeping track of the labour done on the jobs we do. All this tool tracks is who works on what and for how long.

#### Logging In

An account will be created for you, including a password. You can change your password to something memorable whenever you want. 

The computers on the shop floor will show the login screen automatically. If you do not see it, follow the links for Labour, or go to https://index.malleyindustries.com/labour

The first thing you will see is this:

Choose the first letter of your last name.

Choose your name from the list by clicking on it. At any time, if you need to go back, you can click the button in the top right.

Enter your password. If this is your first time, you will have been given a temporary one. If you have forgotten your password or are having trouble signing in, let your supervisor know to have it reset. 

#### Logging Out

At any time, you can log out by clicking on the **Log Out** button at the top right corner of the screen.

As a courtesy to other staff, you should always **Log Out** after you are finished clocking in or out.
