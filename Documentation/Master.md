### Part Order Requests

This tool is intended to make it easier to let us know if a part is needed, and what it's for. You can find everything to do with purchase requests under the Inventory Menu at the top of the Malley Internal Home Page. If you don't have access to that, ask Myles or Kayla for help. 



#### Creating a New Request

Head over to https://index.malleyindustries.com/syspro/purchasing/newRequest

You will be presented with a Request Form. Please fill in as much information as you possibly can, especially if you are requesting a non-stock or new part.

If you know the part number, you can start typing it into the Part Number field. As you type, a list of possible  matches will appear. Clicking on a match will fill out most of the form for you.
