### Part Order Requests

This tool is intended to make it easier to let us know if a part is needed, and what it's for. You can find everything to do with purchase requests under the Inventory Menu at the top of the Malley Internal Home Page. If you don't have access to that, ask Myles or Kayla for help. 



#### Creating a New Request

Head over to https://index.malleyindustries.com/syspro/purchasing/newRequest

You will be presented with a Request Form. Please fill in as much information as you possibly can, especially if you are requesting a non-stock or new part.

If you know the part number, you can start typing it into the Part Number field. As you type, a list of possible  matches will appear. Clicking on a match will fill out most of the form for you.

## Labour Tracking

### For Staff

#### Overview

This is a simple tool for keeping track of the labour done on the jobs we do. All this tool tracks is who works on what and for how long.



#### Logging In

An account will be created for you, including a password. You can change your password to something memorable whenever you want. 

The computers on the shop floor will show the login screen automatically. If you do not see it, follow the links for Labour, or go to https://index.malleyindustries.com/labour

The first thing you will see is this:

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 12-40-32.png)

Choose the first letter of your last name.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 12-42-07.png)

Choose your name from the list by clicking on it. At any time, if you need to go back, you can click the button in the top right.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 12-43-15.png)

Enter your password. If this is your first time, you will have been given a temporary one. If you have forgotten your password or are having trouble signing in, let your supervisor know to have it reset. 



#### Logging Out

At any time, you can log out by clicking on the **Log Out** button at the top right corner of the screen.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 12-47-21.png)

As a courtesy to other staff, you should always **Log Out** after you are finished clocking in or out.



#### Clocking In

To clock in to a job, select it from the **Choose A Job** list you see when you first clock in. The different tabs are the prefixes that are used to categorize jobs. The **RECENT** tab shows the last 10 or so jobs that you have clocked in on if they are still open.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/.png)

The **SEARCH** tab can be used to find jobs if you don't want to filter through a long list. Start typing in the job number and the best matches will be shown.  

When you have found the job you want, click on the large yellow **Start on JOB####** button next to the job number and description. 

If you are done, make sure you **Log Out**.



#### Clocking Out

If you are finished working or are done on a job and ready to work on another one, log in as before. You will see a green box that looks like this:

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-45-46.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Click the **Clock out of ######** button at the top right of the screen. You will then be able to **Log Out** or **Clock In** to a different job.



### For Supervisors / Management

#### Reviewing Staff Tme

To look up labour for a person, department or particular day, click on the **Labour** menu at the top of your screen, and then click on the **See and Make Changes To Labour** link.

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-50-08.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />

From here, you will be presented with a box with different options.

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-52-43.png)

The reports filter based on the inputs given. All Staff returns work on a single date. By Department filters by department for a single date. By Person and Dates takes an individual and returns their labour between a start and end date. 

When you have, for example, selected a date to look up and hit **Go**, the screen will update with all matching results. The results are presented in the form of a person's daily Time Card.

Somone who has booked labour on a day will look something like this:

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-56-27.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />

A day with no labour on it looks like this:

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-56-48.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-56-48" style="zoom: 50%;" />



#### Add New Time

If a person has forgotten to clock on to a job, you can add time to their time card. Find the correct person and date using one of the options provided:

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 13-52-43.png" style="zoom:33%;" />

In the top-right corner of the time card in question, click the green **Add** button. A new green form will appear to the right hand side of the time card you are editing.  **The time card you are working with will also change colour to be easier to see**.

<img src="/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 14-04-34.png" style="zoom: 33%;" />

Fill in the green **Add Labour to [NAME] on [DATE]** form fields. They are all required. 

![](/home/myles/Dropbox/PhpstormProjects/Malley/Documentation/Master.assets/Screenshot from 2021-12-14 14-06-10.png)

The box at the bottom of the form will let you choose the job they are working on. The **RECENT** tab shows the last few jobs that person has been clocked in to that are still open in Syspro. the **SEARCH** tab allows you to find the right one you are looking for.

When you are done, click on the **Add Labour** button. If there are no errors to be fixed, the time is added and the person's time card is updated.

If there are errors, you will be prompted to fix them before you can add the time. 

You can cancel this at any time before saving changes. If you leave the page or go to make changes on another record before saving this new labour though, it will be lost.
